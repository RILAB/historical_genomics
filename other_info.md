W755 and W771 are the parents of ND246.

Inbred W755 = KN 2 x W291
 
Inbred W771 = W595 x W291 . EP25 x W593

Inbred W291 = Pyrenees Mts. Flint

Inbred W593 = Oh40B X 2B . W151C

Inbred W151C = 643 X Minne #13 (in the notes, it says, similar to W117)

Inbred W595 = W253A X W217J . W37B

Inbred W217J = W5 . W5 X 698-6

Inbred W5 = Golden Chippewa

Inbred W253A = Golden Chippewa X Long

Inbred W37B = D X 374

D = Wis. #25

There is a W374 (Red) = CF808 (4Co.63) - Brink, this is unlikely to be 374 given the year of release, though. 

The EP lines, it says here that are from the Ponteverda experiment station in Spain (breeder J.L Blanco). I don't have that pedigree.

There is no mention of KN 2,  specifically EP25 or 2B.

Attached are the registrations for Mo45-49.  I will try to find the story with Mo.940, probably need to check with Larry Darrah on that one.
 
Really tragic about Steve Szalma.  I felt bad I was at winter nursery when his memorial was but the people from my lab who trying to drive up got caught in the snow and had to turn back. 
 
Am copying Jeff if he is interested in the pedigrees also. 
 
## Howie on Minn. inbreds and pedigree reading

#####JRI: 

So here’s a naive question for you.  When it says a lines parents are e.g. A9 X A26, am I correct that that means an F1 of those two lines was made, and the line of interest was selfed out of that F1?  Such that while the expectation is that A111 and A112 will be essentially full sibs, share 50% genetic material, and each have 50% from both parents, because they could be selfed from different F2  there will be noise around those expectations.


##### Howie: 

Yes. The pedigree is in this case is the F1 cross, and likely A111 and A112 were selfed from different F2 plants (but not always, we would need the selection ID from the breeders books to know for sure, there are splitters and lumpers, some breeders would code more than one line that trace back to the same F2, F4 or F4 line usually depending on how variable the F3 was).
A couple of other variables, lines develop early in the breeding process may have been bulked, ie multiple plants from a line selfed and bulked together at the S4(F5), S5(F6) or S7(F7) stage of inbreeding.
One the line was bulked it was frequently maintained by random-mating of the plants, by hand or in isolation.  The stage at which the bulking was done depended on how difficult it was to maintain the line by selfing.  Early inbreds suffered a great deal of inbreeding depression.  When I was at ISU in the 1970’s Dr. Russell the breeder there had a student look at hybrid performance for hybrids made from S4, S5 or S6 lines.  This was also the time single cross hybrids were being widely used and S4 females would yield better than S5 or S6 lines for some inbreds.  A lot of this information ie selection ID, still probably exist as most universities have kept the nursery books, but it would take some time and effort to gather this information.

## Miscellaneous info from Howie

#### Lancaster

As I thought about this I thought of a couple of things [1]Hershery talks about selecting for yield and ignoring everything else in the initial stages, and later selection for uniformity, experience shows that once you stop selecting for yield, yield drops, but given the way he was selecting for yield – visual appearance of the ears, it seems hard to believe he could make much progress for yield.   [2] Hershey was periodically introducing new material into his population of Lancaster, this likely would have maintained the vigor and heterozygousity, in his population. [3] they may have changed the way they handled the population once they got into the seed business and selected for uniformity.  They might have selected a smaller sample of ears for uniformity and planted these ears in a separate area and used the seed from these to sell, and maybe select the best for the next generation increase.  There is no mention of this and I think the Ne would have to have gotten less than 50 to generate enough homozygosity to allow for purging of deleterious recessives.  However, I believe that I have read that Funks used this method when they developed Funks Reid, and the seed they sold of it.
 
A little background on the Funks family, this family settled around Bloomington Ill, and started out in the cattle business.  Over time the family (several brothers as I remember it) acquired on the order of 10,000 acres in central Ill.  Since they were feeding so much corn to their cattle they got into the corn breeding business and Gene Funk worked to develop their own version of Reid.  He later hired James Holbert, who had met and talked to H. K. Hayes about hybrid corn.  Holbert stated a large inbreed program at Funks, and later Holbert joined the USDA, but did his work at the Funks farm.  His work let to Funks getting into the hybrid seed business.
 
Have you seen or do you have a copy of the book entitled ‘The Hybrid Corn Makers’ by Richard Crabb.  It gives a very readable history of the development of hybrid corn and the breeders involved.  I have a copy I can send/lend you if you have trouble finding a copy.

#### Seed sources

Do you know of any sources of landraces that might be in private ownership?   The only people I can think of that might know would be Forrest Troyer, who has not responded to the last mail message I send him a month or so ago (a year or so ago I was in email contact with him on a pretty regular basis).  Kendal Lamkey is the second person, he has been involved with some of the groups that have been promoting organic agriculture and non-hybrid corn growing (I believe).  There was a farmer some years back, I have forgotten his name, that got quite a lot of press for his organic farming methods, including corn and soybeans.  His farm was near Boone.  Maybe Kendall would be the person to contact.  Jeff, do you know Kendall Lamkey at ISU (now head of the Agronomy Dept)?

#### On Historical Genomics

Thanks for your reply.  I have been working on adding the pedigrees for the public lines to my copy of the list of inbreds for your study.  As you state in your paper the Open Pollinated Varieties (OPVs) exhibit very little structure, and many of the cycle 1 inbreds you have, are derived from selfing out of these OPVs, and probably have very little structure as far as breeding or heterotic pools.  (the inbred WF9 is a self out of the OPV Wilson Farm Reid, and the inbred TR9 is a self out of Troyer Reid, which was a self out of Reid Yellow Dent).
 
If you look at the development of breeding/heterotic pools in the US, many OPVs were sampled and resulted in inbreds derived by selfing in these varieties.  The inbreds were used primarily in double cross hybrids, and were randomly used on both sides of the hybrid pedigree, choosing a single cross that made a good seed parent (lots of medium flat kernels, minimize number of large flat, large round, and small round seed sizes – the medium flats planted more uniformly given the seed planters at the time).  The best of these first cycle inbreds where then used in pedigree breeding systems and crosses were made to correct weaknesses in the better inbreds, i.e. improve disease resistance, standability,  etc.  Again, source of the parental inbreds in these breeding crosses not generally taken into account.  An example is the early developed Pioneer DC hybrid 307 which has lines from the following OPVs (Lancaster*Krug/Leaming*Reid) all first cycle inbreds. The OPV Krug is consider a Reid type.  This hybrid exhibited drought tolerance in 1936 a major drought year in the Cornbelt (middle of the dust bowl years), and was a major factor in farmers acceptance of hybrid corn.
 
    In was not until the 1960s when single crosses were commercialized that breeding pools and heterotic groups evolved.   The Iowa State Stiff Stalk Population, which was formed from 16 inbreds chosen on the basis of stalk strength became the female population because with the sale of single cross hybrids you needed a high yielding female parent, and the inbreds B14, and B37 along with WF9 and later B73 fit the need (WF9 was later dropped because it did not tolerate higher plant densities that the production systems moved to at about the same time).  The NSS pool by default became all inbreds that combined well with B14, B37, and B73 in hybrid combination.  The Iodent breeding pool is very narrow, it is based largely on the two lines IDT and I205 from the Iowa State Iodent variety.  These two lines were crossed with both Minnesota 13 inbreds (for earliness), Lancaster inbreds (for ear size) and SS derived inbreds, but Iodent germplasm is mainly used opposite early SS lines in the northern Cornbelt.  It was originally identified because the Iodent lines had early maturity, good yield, and good stalk strength, a rare combination for early germplasm.  The Iodent lines made good hybrids when crossed to both SS lines and OH43 derived inbreds.  It a major source of inbreds for the Northern Cornbelt.  
 
   For the public NSS pool two lines play a key role, OH43 in the north-central and northern Cornbelt, and Mo17 in the central Cornbelt.   OH43 is a second cycle line that traces back to Richey’s version of Lancaster (Richey was the first head of the USDA that set up the public/university hybrid corn breeding programs), and Mo17 has C103 a first cycle Lancaster line from the Conn Ag Expt Sta(East/Jones’ program).  The other parent is a Krug derived line C187-2 which has good stress tolerance.  In general the first cycle Lancaster lines saw little used due to weak stalk strength.  Other lines that contributed traits needed were crossed to the core lines in the SS and NSS pools to expand them, but once the SX hybrids were being used inbreds would be only added to one of the breeding pools (in most cases, always exceptions in biological systems). So once companies started selling single cross hybrids, they needed two breeding pools, a female pool with good inbred seed yields, strong germination characteristics for the hybrid seed produced on the female inbred, acceptable distribution of seed sizes, good yield in hybrid combination; and a male pool, good disease resistance-the original SS lines did not have a lot of disease resistance, good standability, good pollen production, good grain quality- the B73 and B14 were soft textured.   The breeders were looking for high yield hybrids, and realized that they needed to keep the male and female pools separate to maximize heterosis.  So the heterotic pools and breeding pools evolved pretty much simultaneously.   Much of the distance between them initially was likely due to sampling, i.e. the relatively small number of lines that went into each of these pools and the distance between them has evolved as a result of selecting for hybrid performance while keeping the pools separate.
 
#### Small NE

Yes and no or what to you consider a small Ne.  I would estimate that they saved a least 1500 ears each year during the selection process, and each ear would have had 200-400+ kernels.  The female Ne might be as low as 1500, but probably closer to 2500-3500, but the male Ne would be very large.  Hershey would have save enough seed to plant his 40 acres next year which would have required over 500,000 (40acres * 12,000 plants per acre final stand) kernels and likely more depending on what he thought the germination rate was. (this would likely be 15 or so bushels of shelled corn).  Hershey I have read did not actually harvest his corn and had others do it and select the ears according to his specifications.  He did however, inspect each ear and make final selections when the ears where shelled.  He also likely saved enough so that he could share or sell to neighbors.
These are estimates on my part based on what I have heard and read.  The scientist from Pioneer who interviewed Hershey are no longer alive.  I don’t know if any of the Hershey family members are alive or not.
 
The population that had a small Ne was the original Reid variety developed by Robert and James Reid.  They selected ears that were based on Corn Ear Show judging criteria, and Dr. Brown indicates that breeders did think  that this suffered from mild inbreeding depression.  However, there were many Reid populations, i.e. Funks Reid, Troyer Reid, Krug (Reid plus other material) Osterland etc., and in fact many of the Reid populations had other material incorporated into them.   So Reid derived inbreds are quite variable, as inbreds from any of these populations would be classified as Reid. 
 
Lancaster derived inbreds were used quite extensively as first cycle inbreds in hybrid combination, but by the 1940s their use in the central Cornbelt had dropped quite dramatically as their reputation for poor root strength caught up with them and other lines with better root strength became available.  The other Lancaster derived inbreds were the earlier inbreds developed by    at the Ohio experimental station, ie OH40, and especially OH43 which was widely used in hybrids and as a parent in breeding crosses in the Northern Cornbelt, ie Northern Iowa,  Northern Illinois, South Dakota, Southern Minnesota, Southern Wisconsin, Michigan, Northern Indiana, Penn, NY.  This is quite a large area and OH43 derived inbreds are still widely used in this area.   Pioneer incorporated some C103 (a Conn. derived Lancaster line) into its male pool and the public line Mo17, C103/187-2, has been widely used by the seed industry.  C103, CN123 and Oh43 are the main Lancaster derived lines widely used in the commercial seed industry.  C103 and Mo17 were also widely used in China as parents (initially) and in breeding crosses with locally derived germplasm to incorporate resistance to local disease complexes.      

Unfortunately, most of the public sources of these populations have been maintained by sib mating in relative small population sizes, ie the Plant Introduction Stations increase their seed supplies periodically by planting out 4-10 rows and making plant to plant crosses, generating 50 to 100 ears and shelling these as a bulk.  Doing this over several generations has likely lead to a reduced variability in these populations.  Selection is inadvertently done for plants that flower about the same time and all the crosses are made usually over a week or 10 days time frame.  Directed selection may not be practiced, but indirect selection is (males must flower when silks are available, any hard to bag tassels get ignored, plants with delayed silking, producing silks from small ear shoots etc.).

#### BSSS background

Dr. Sprague stated the idea of putting together a series of synthetic populations was that of Dr. Richey and Henry Wallace.  Don Duvick in ‘GENESIS AND EVOLUTION OF PLANT BREEDING IN THE HI-BRED CORN COMPANY’ (not published to my knowledge) states the following: “Raymond Baker, in a letter to Henry Wallace in the early 1930s, had recommended a recycling method that went beyond simply selfing in F2 or backcross populations.  After noting that selfing in farmer OPVs was no longer productive, he suggested making a series of new synthetic varieties.  Each variety would be made by intercrossing several inbreds that were especially strong in a given quality, such as stiff stalks or disease resistance. Then each variety, after some generations of recombination, might be used for production of new inbreds with a new and higher level of performance. Not long after that time, Wallace suggested (to F. D. Richey, head of the USDA corn breeding programs at the time) the production of several synthetic varieties, using the best inbred lines of the day, selected for high yield, for stiff stalks, for drought tolerance, and so on. Eventually one of those synthetics, in the hands of George Sprague at Iowa State College, became the well-known Iowa State Stiff Stalk Synthetic (BSSS). There is no paper trail to prove that Baker’s letter was the inspiration for formation of SSS, but the ‘coincidence of suggestion and action is noteworthy’.  Dr. Richey was head of the USDA corn breeding program at Arlington (the USDA research station was located in Arlington, near the present day Pentagon building, before it was moved to Beltsville) at the time and Dr. Sprague was a technician working there.  Therefore Dr. Sprague was given the job of putting the synthetics together and the first crosses for these synthetics one of which became the Stiff Stalk Synthetic was started in 1933 and 1934 (Sprague 1946).   The singles were made in Arlington and then Dr. Sprague went to University of Missouri to head up the USDA corn breeding project there, and these populations were sent to Dr. Jenkins at Ames where the rest of the crosses were made to form the populations.  Finally the populations were random-mated for 3 or 4 generations at which time they were put on the shelf (probably around 1935 or 1936).  No one in the USDA or at Ames was interested in working with these populations at this time.    In 1937 or 1938 Dr. Sprague moved to Ames and wanted to do some early generation testing based on work that Jenkins had been doing.  He chose to work with Stiff Stalk Synthetic primarily because of its name and the need for better stalk quality at the time.  In 1939 when the first topcrosses were made Dr. Sprague indicated they essentially had no performance data on Stiff Stalk Synthetic but that they grew a diallel with Stiff Stalk Synthetic and several other synthetics that were put together either the same time as BSSS or shortly after.  Dr. Sprague indicated that the 16 lines that went into Stiff Stalk Synthetic were chosen primarily for their stalk strength and little attention was given to their yielding ability in hybrids.  Several of the other synthetics that were put together at the same time as the Stiff Stalk Synthetic were sampled after the success with Stiff Stalk, but nothing came out of this work. (Notes from a discussion Howie Smith had with Dr. Sprague at the Ill Corn Breeders School in 1988).
