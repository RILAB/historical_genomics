Plants make rapid, vigorous development throughout the growth period.  Susceptible to stalk smut and to diplodia stalk rot, plants sometimes break badly after maturity.  This line usually produces a high yield of quality seed.  It is preferably used as a seed parent in making single crosses because of the high production and quality of seed, its poor pollen-producing ability and its few or no suckers to detassel.""","DEVELOPED  1934 Iowa, United States by Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station.

Pollen production is satisfactory; silks emerge about 2 days after the first shedding of pollen; and seed set is good on both ears.

The line has intermediate resistance to broods of the European corn leaf blight, first and second broods of the European corn borer, but it is susceptible to sorghum downy mildew.  Yield data from single-cross evaluations for 4 years in Iowa show that B79 had the highest average yield of the lines tested in single crosses with Mo17.  Although the line is late in silk emergence, this lateness is not evident in single crosses on the basis of grain moisture at harvest.  The inbred contributes a strong root system to hybrids; its contribution for stalk strength is adequate, but not outstanding.  Extensive evaluation has shown that B79 is adapted to southern and south-central Iowa.  Maturity classification is late AES800.","DEVELOPED   Iowa, United States by Russell, W., Iowa State University; Hallauer, A., Iowa State University.

Plants 178 cm in height (to tassel tip), 56 cm ear height (to base of top ear), 11 cm long top ear internode, no tillers, single ear per stalk, normal cytoplasm.  The stalk is of average strength and the roots are fair.  Leaves are dark green, 30-60 degrees angle from stalk (upper half), light sheath pubescence, few marginal waves, longitudinal creases absent.  Ear node leaf average width of 10 cm at widest point and length of 72 cm.  There are 14 leaves per mature plant, separated by relatively short internodes.  Anthers are red and extrude from a green glume with red points of dehiscent.  Ear is medium in length and has average taper, it is attached to a strong shank of medium length, and has a short husk extension.  Kernels are arranged in 16 slightly curved rows.

Selection was based on half-sib progeny performances with Ia13 double-cross as the tester parent.  The designation was changed to BS13(S2)CO because S2 progeny became the basis for evaluation in the next cycle of selection.  B84 evolved from one of the 10 S2 lines selected for recombination to give BS13(S2)C1 [BS13(S2)C1 (PI 608782) is registered in Crop Sci. 19:755].  The line has been developed by selection and self-pollination in the ear-to-row system for six generations.  The plant has an erect-leaf orientation and will produce a high frequency of harvestable second ears when the plant density is less than 40,000 plants/ha.  Pollen production is good, and silks emerge 1 to 2 days after the first shedding of pollen.  The date of silk emergence is 1 to 2 days later than that of B73.  Most ears have 14 to 16 kernel rows; the seed is yellow with a rounded crown and shallow dent and intermediate in size.  Seed yield is good, being slightly higher than that of B73.  Inbred B84 has intermediate resistance to leaf feeding by the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hubner).  Data from single-cross evaluations for 4 years in south-central and southern Iowa show that B84 yields better than B73 in single-cross hybrids, has similar root and stalk strength, but drops fewer ears.  Although B84 was developed from the same recurrent selection program as was B73, but two cycles later, the yield performance of the single cross between the two lines indicates that they should not be considered sister lines.  Maturity classification is AES800.","DEVELOPED   Iowa, United States by Russell, W., Iowa State University.

Plants 183 cm in height (to tassel tip), 71 cm ear height (to base of top ear), 13 cm long top ear internode, no tillers, strong two-ear tendency, normal cytoplasm.  Leaves are medium green, 30-60 degrees angle from stalk (upper half), medium sheath pubescence, few marginal waves, longitudinal creases absent.  The average ear node leaf width is 9 cm at its widest point with a length of 66 cm.  Tassels have 18 lateral branches, 30-40 degrees of branch angle from central spike, peduncle length of 36 cm from top leaf to basal branches, heavy pollen shed, yellow anther and glume.  Ears 12 cm in length, 45 mm mid-point diameter, 54 grams in weight, 14 distinct straight kernel rows, green silk (exposed at silking stage), light green husk color (fresh), buff husk color (dry), very long husk extension (harvest stage), husk leaf length greater than 15 cm, 12 cm long shank with five internodes, upright position at dry husk stage, slight taper, average drying time (unhusked ear).

P737M20 differs from Iowa 2132 in that P737M20 possesses the Ht gene for dominant resistance to northern corn leaf blight and Iowa 2132 does not.  Also, the physiological response of P737M20 to Helminthosporium turcicum is different from that of Iowa 2132; when infected by H. turcicum, P737M20 will develop small resistant non-sporulating lesions while the lesions produced by infected Iowa 2132 will be large and sporulate, thus spreading the disease.","DEVELOPED  01/05/1979 Michigan, United States by Asgrow Seed Company.

Genetic composition of the population FS8(A)S (PI 536619) is estimated to be approx. 50% BSSS related, 21% tropical, 18% southeastern U.S., and 11% diverse Corn Belt (with a high proportion of inbred C103A). Breeder's seed of GEMS-0002 was increased by controlled full-sib pollination of the S3 in the 2002 OSU nursery. Seed from over 100 ears was bulked for distribution. It has been released to GEM cooperators following the GEM protocol. Mid-silk date is approx. one week earlier than that of B73 in Ohio, and it produces moderate amounts of pollen. Plant height is quite moderate (ave=133.2 cm) and ear placement is slightly below mid-plant height (ave=55.8 cm). Cob color is white and ears generally display 12 kernel rows (average 12.5, range 10-16). Ear width is approx. 3.8 cm (range 3.5 to 4.4 cm). Ear length is approx. 13.2 cm (range 11 to 15 cm). Kernels are yellow to yellow-orange in color and are slightly dented to flinty and have a 100 kernel weight of 21.7 g. Grain protein composition is somewhat elevated (approx. 2 to 2.5 points above B73) and average density is 1.35 g/cc. Line has not been exposed to high levels of foliar or stalk-rotting diseases and definitive information concerning its susceptibility to pests and diseases is unknown.  GEMS-0002 is intended as a breeding resource for the improvement and diversification of elite, non-'Lancaster Sure-Crop' related inbreds. Unique in that it has a relatively high proportion of tropical germplasm yet is able to impart earliness to hybrids. It has potential as a source of germplasm in breeding programs throughout much of the U.S. Corn Belt. Recommended that it be introduced into breeding programs by crossing with elite inbreds followed by modified pedigree selection. Using this method, it is anticipated the agronomic characteristics can still be improved since only one cycle of selection has been practiced.","DEVELOPED  03/24/2002 Ohio, United States by Pollak, L., USDA, ARS; Montgomery, K., Central Golden Harvest Research; Pratt, R., The Ohio State University.

The line was developed by selection and self pollination in the ear-to-row system at high plant densities (approximately 59,000 plants/ha) for five generations.  The first hybrid evaluation was in a S0 plant x H99 testcross in a recurrent selection program, and evaluations with H99 were continued in successive selfing generations.  Data obtained in 11 experiments conducted from 1976 to 1980 in northern Iowa show that B87 is comparable to A632 for hybrid yield performance and superior for resistance to root and stalk lodging.  Silk emergence for the line is 1 day earlier than for A632 (Iowa Exp. Stn. strain).  The top ear node is approximately 10 cm lower than that of A632.  With artificial infestation of first-brood, European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis, Hubner), the resistance rating is 3 (1 = highly resistant, 9 = highly susceptible).  Pollen production and silk emergence are good under drought stress conditions: seed yield is comparable to that of A632.  The ear is slender, slightly tapered with length similar to that of A632, and most ears have 12 kernel rows.  The kernel has a smooth, shallow dent and intermediate yellow color.

These included several hundred plant introductions including 70 accessions from the Latin American Maize Project (LAMP). Our results revealed  several plant introductions that contributed high amylose modifiers raising amylose levels to at least 70% in the F3 kernels. Only lines from GUAT209:S13 x (H99ae x OH43ae) were found to survive inbreeding and therefore used in subsequent breeding studies while the others were dropped.  GUAT209:S13 is a 50% tropical exotic derived from crossing the LAMP accession Guatemala 209 (PI 498583) to a proprietary stiff stalk inbred from a private GEM cooperator designated as company 13.  Guatemala 209 is a yellow flint population from the tropical race, Tus n. The original GUAT209:S13 F1 seed was planted in a winter nursery in Puerto Rico; F1 plants produced ears segregating F2 seeds in the expected 3:1 phenotypic ratio for normal and ae-type kernels.  Mutant ae F2 kernels were visually selected and used to establish F2 plants producing homozygous ae F2 ears (F3 seed) in the summer of 1998 at Kirksville, MO.   For each (H99ae x OH43ae) x exotic cross, grain samples from at least three F2 ears were analyzed for starch amylose using a colorimetric iodine-amylose procedure (Williams, 1958) following starch extraction and purification.  Remnant grain samples were used for inbreeding in order to attempt to fix the modifiers.

From the non-stiff stalk source H99ae x OH 43ae; of mixed heterotic derivation, composed of 50% non-stiff stalk and 50% stiff stalk. Subsequent crosses made with GEMS-0067 to both SS and NS testers have shown good yield in preliminary data over 2 years. GEMS-0067, having modifiers from GUAT209-S13 was compared to several public inbreds possessing the ae gene but without high amylose modifier genes. Starch was isolated from 2 bulk samples obtained from independent single-row plots derived from 2 GEMS-0067 S4 ears produced in 2004. Bulk samples from the converted lines H99ae, OH43ae, B89ae and B84ae grown in the same year were used for starch isolation. Analysis of amylose using the IA method confirmed the presence of modifiers in 2 samples obtained from GEMs-0067. Apparent amylose can be elevated as the result of long chained amylopectin; gel permeation chromatography (GPC) searates amylopectin from amylose and the intermediate components. Therefore, the GPC analysis method results in higher amylose values in comparison to the IA method ; GEMS-0067 displayed a relatively higher amylose value based on analysis of GPC amylose peaks. The resistant starch (RS) was also measured by using the Assoc. of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) method for total dietary fiber content for all samples. The RS content of GEMS-0067 starch samples was approximately two times higher than that of the converted public lines. The RS content of the starch samples was positively correlated with the amylose content of the starch, with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.89. Thermal properties of the native high-amylose maize starch: water mixtures (3:1 ratio) were determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetery (DSC). All of the starch samples displayed similar onset gelatinization temperature (63.8-65.0?C). Broader gelatinization temperature ranges were observed for GEMS-0067 starches. The conclusion temperatures of these also varied from 104.8 to 106.7?C, and were substantially higher for GEMS-0067 starch than for the other starch samples (92.8-94.2?C. The results indicated that starch granules of GEMS-0067 samples were not completely gelatinized after cooking at boiling temperature; this is probably due to the increased amylose and intermediate component content.","DEVELOPED   Missouri, United States by Pollak, L., USDA, ARS; Campbell, M., Truman State University; Jane, J., Iowa State University; Blanco, M., USDA, ARS; O'Brien, A., Truman State University.

In the U.S., maize is the primary energy-supplying grain for animal feed.  However, it is often an inadequate source of protein due to deficiencies in essential amino acids such as lysine, methionine, and tryptophan.  Methionine is a particularly important amino acid in poultry nutrition; of the maize used for animal feed, 20% is fed to poultry.  In the U.S., more than $200 million in synthetic methionine supplements are added to poultry rations annually.  USDA may prohibit synthetic methionine-supplemented feed for organic egg production after October, 2008. Thus, the lines hereby available may be even more highly valued.

Statistical analyses of the NIRS (Near Infrared Reflectance Spectrometry) data using the Tukey and Dunnett tests were performed using the GLM procedures, a function of SAS.  Methionine levels in both backgrounds are significant at the 0.05 level compared to their corresponding inbreds.   Methionine levels were measured using NIRS and HPLC procedures at the University of Minnesota.  A Foss North America (Model 6500) NIRS instrument was used to efficiently screen genotypes.  A NIRS equation was developed for predicting methionine levels of ground-kernels.  On an individual sample basis, the correlation between NIRS-predicted methionine level and HPLC-measured methionine was 0.79.  The correlation between genotype means of NIRS-predicted methionine and genotype means of HPLC-measured methonine was 0.91.

In the U.S., maize is the primary energy-supplying grain for animal feed.  However, it is often an inadequate source of protein due to deficiencies in essential amino acids such as lysine, methionine, and tryptophan.  Methionine is a particularly important amino acid in poultry nutrition; of the maize used for animal feed, 20% is fed to poultry.  In the U.S., more than $200 million in synthetic methionine supplements are added to poultry rations annually.  USDA may prohibit synthetic methionine-supplemented feed for organic egg production after October, 2008. Thus, the lines hereby available may be even more highly valued.
