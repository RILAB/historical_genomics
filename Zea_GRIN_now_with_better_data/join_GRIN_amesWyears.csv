It flowers about 1 day later than B14A.  It has good general combining ability and is very high yielding in certain crosses.  N7A machine-combines poorly at high moisture levels but is a very good sheller at lower moisture levels.  It has good late season health as a line but tends toward premature death in crosses.  It tends to have above average resistance to leaf freckles and wilt and has good resistance to wheat streak mosaic virus and downy mildew.  Its cold germination and early vigor should be adequate for use as a single cross seed parent, and pollen shed is adequate for its use as a male.  Tassels extrude well for detasseling but pull hard.  Maturity clasification is about AES700.","DEVELOPED  1968 Nebraska, United States by Compton, W., University of Nebraska; Lonnquist, J.; Williams, N..

With artificial infestation of first-brood, European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis, Hubner), the resistance rating is 3 (1 = highly resistant, 9 = highly susceptible).  Pollen production and silk emergence are good under drought stress conditions: seed yield is comparable to that of A632.  The ear is slender, slightly tapered with length similar to that of A632, and most ears have 12 kernel rows.  The kernel has a smooth, shallow dent and intermediate yellow color.  The plant will produce a high frequency of second ears when the plant density is less than 40,000 plants/ha.  B87 seems to be a line that can be used as male or female in single-cross seed production.  Maturity classification is AES600.","DEVELOPED   Iowa, United States by Russell, W., Iowa State University.

Breeding lines from the cross PI 503806 x B94 were advanced by backcrossing to B94 three generations. Throughout the breeding program, donor plants were selected by evaluating their resistance to European corn borer feeding on leaf blades, leaf sheaths, and collars of plants artificially infested with the insect. Only selected resistant plants were carried forward in the breeding effort. Third generation backcross seed were grown in Ames, IA in 1999 and plants were full sib-mated to obtain a seed increase for distribution. In addition to European corn borer resistance, also selected for superior yield compared to other experimental lines in the resistance breeding program. 160 second generation backcross parents from the breeding program were tested for yield.

Genetic composition of the population FS8(A)S (PI 536619) is estimated to be approx. 50% BSSS related, 21% tropical, 18% southeastern U.S., and 11% diverse Corn Belt (with a high proportion of inbred C103A). Breeder's seed of GEMS-0002 was increased by controlled full-sib pollination of the S3 in the 2002 OSU nursery. Seed from over 100 ears was bulked for distribution. It has been released to GEM cooperators following the GEM protocol. Mid-silk date is approx. one week earlier than that of B73 in Ohio, and it produces moderate amounts of pollen. Plant height is quite moderate (ave=133.2 cm) and ear placement is slightly below mid-plant height (ave=55.8 cm). Cob color is white and ears generally display 12 kernel rows (average 12.5, range 10-16). Ear width is approx. 3.8 cm (range 3.5 to 4.4 cm). Ear length is approx. 13.2 cm (range 11 to 15 cm). Kernels are yellow to yellow-orange in color and are slightly dented to flinty and have a 100 kernel weight of 21.7 g. Grain protein composition is somewhat elevated (approx. 2 to 2.5 points above B73) and average density is 1.35 g/cc. Line has not been exposed to high levels of foliar or stalk-rotting diseases and definitive information concerning its susceptibility to pests and diseases is unknown.  GEMS-0002 is intended as a breeding resource for the improvement and diversification of elite, non-'Lancaster Sure-Crop' related inbreds. Unique in that it has a relatively high proportion of tropical germplasm yet is able to impart earliness to hybrids. It has potential as a source of germplasm in breeding programs throughout much of the U.S. Corn Belt. Recommended that it be introduced into breeding programs by crossing with elite inbreds followed by modified pedigree selection. Using this method, it is anticipated the agronomic characteristics can still be improved since only one cycle of selection has been practiced.","DEVELOPED  03/24/2002 Ohio, United States by Pollak, L., USDA, ARS; Montgomery, K., Central Golden Harvest Research; Pratt, R., The Ohio State University.

These included several hundred plant introductions including 70 accessions from the Latin American Maize Project (LAMP). Our results revealed  several plant introductions that contributed high amylose modifiers raising amylose levels to at least 70% in the F3 kernels. Only lines from GUAT209:S13 x (H99ae x OH43ae) were found to survive inbreeding and therefore used in subsequent breeding studies while the others were dropped.  GUAT209:S13 is a 50% tropical exotic derived from crossing the LAMP accession Guatemala 209 (PI 498583) to a proprietary stiff stalk inbred from a private GEM cooperator designated as company 13.  Guatemala 209 is a yellow flint population from the tropical race, Tus n. The original GUAT209:S13 F1 seed was planted in a winter nursery in Puerto Rico; F1 plants produced ears segregating F2 seeds in the expected 3:1 phenotypic ratio for normal and ae-type kernels.  Mutant ae F2 kernels were visually selected and used to establish F2 plants producing homozygous ae F2 ears (F3 seed) in the summer of 1998 at Kirksville, MO.   For each (H99ae x OH43ae) x exotic cross, grain samples from at least three F2 ears were analyzed for starch amylose using a colorimetric iodine-amylose procedure (Williams, 1958) following starch extraction and purification.  Remnant grain samples were used for inbreeding in order to attempt to fix the modifiers.  GEMS-0067 is currently maintained as an S4 line from GUAT209:S13 x (H99ae x OH43ae).",40,NA,"",":GEMS-0067","USA005","10",NA,NA,"Vigorous line with pollen shed occurring approx. 4 d before B73, average plant height of 174 cm, upright leaf structure, yellow kernels and red cob. From the non-stiff stalk source H99ae x OH 43ae; of mixed heterotic derivation, composed of 50% non-stiff stalk and 50% stiff stalk. Subsequent crosses made with GEMS-0067 to both SS and NS testers have shown good yield in preliminary data over 2 years. GEMS-0067, having modifiers from GUAT209-S13 was compared to several public inbreds possessing the ae gene but without high amylose modifier genes. Starch was isolated from 2 bulk samples obtained from independent single-row plots derived from 2 GEMS-0067 S4 ears produced in 2004. Bulk samples from the converted lines H99ae, OH43ae, B89ae and B84ae grown in the same year were used for starch isolation. Analysis of amylose using the IA method confirmed the presence of modifiers in 2 samples obtained from GEMs-0067. Apparent amylose can be elevated as the result of long chained amylopectin; gel permeation chromatography (GPC) searates amylopectin from amylose and the intermediate components. Therefore, the GPC analysis method results in higher amylose values in comparison to the IA method ; GEMS-0067 displayed a relatively higher amylose value based on analysis of GPC amylose peaks. The resistant starch (RS) was also measured by using the Assoc. of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) method for total dietary fiber content for all samples. The RS content of GEMS-0067 starch samples was approximately two times higher than that of the converted public lines. The RS content of the starch samples was positively correlated with the amylose content of the starch, with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.89. Thermal properties of the native high-amylose maize starch: water mixtures (3:1 ratio) were determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetery (DSC). All of the starch samples displayed similar onset gelatinization temperature (63.8-65.0?C). Broader gelatinization temperature ranges were observed for GEMS-0067 starches. The conclusion temperatures of these also varied from 104.8 to 106.7?C, and were substantially higher for GEMS-0067 starch than for the other starch samples (92.8-94.2?C. The results indicated that starch granules of GEMS-0067 samples were not completely gelatinized after cooking at boiling temperature; this is probably due to the increased amylose and intermediate component content.","DEVELOPED   Missouri, United States by Pollak, L., USDA, ARS; Campbell, M., Truman State University; Jane, J., Iowa State University; Blanco, M., USDA, ARS; O'Brien, A., Truman State University.

Leaves are  dark green, light sheath pubescence, no marginal wave, longitudinal creases absent.  The ear node leaf has an average width of 5 cm and  length of 58 cm.  There are 8 leaves per mature plant.  Tassels have 10 lateral branches, 30-40 degrees of branch angle from central spike, peduncle length of 7 cm from top leaf to basal branches, medium pollen shed, yellow anther and glume.  Ears are 20 cm in length, 40 mm mid-point diameter, 106 grams in weight, 16 distinct slightly curved kernel rows, well filled to the tips, green silk (exposed at silking stage), dark green husk color (fresh), buff husk color (dry), long husk extension (harvest stage), husk leaf medium length, 13 cm long shank with six internodes, upright position at dry husk stage, average taper, slow drying time (unhusked ear).  Kernel (dried, from ear mid-point) 9 mm long, 6 mm wide, 4 mm thick, shape grade less than 20% rounds, pericarp colorless, aleurone homozygous yellow, endosperm yellow, extra sweet (sh2) type endosperm, 9 gm weight/100 seeds.  Cob 23 mm diameter at mid-point, weak, white.  Susceptible to northern leaf blight, bacterial leaf blight, and earworm.  This inbred most closely resembles Iowa 2132 (su1) for maturity, plant type, ear type, and kernel type, and Illinois 453 (sh2) for edible quality.  Ear length and husk extension of Florida 32 are slightly shorter than that of Iowa 2132.  The major difference between Iowa 2132 and Florida 32 is that Florida 32 has the homozygous recessive sh2 gene, whereas, Iowa 2132 has the homozygous recessive su1 gene.  Plants are five to six feet tall under good conditions in the Idaho seed production area and average 1.5 tillers per plant that are two to six feet tall.  Difficulty has been encountered in producing good stands in Idaho, particularly early in the season when soil temperatures are cool.  Seedlings are very susceptible to damping off.","DEVELOPED  05/22/1975 Florida, United States by Florida Foundation Seed Producers, Inc..
