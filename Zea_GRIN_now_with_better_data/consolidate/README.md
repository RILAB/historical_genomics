## Consolidating Howie's pedigree info with GBS and GRIN

NB: Some .csvs in up a directory.

This file is basically for checking the amount of overlap between GBS data with Howie's and with GRIN/USDA.

From the merged files "new.csv/txt" there are a total of 18 complete cases with two known parents, year released, known pop. structure, and GBS data from Romay et al.

It might be prudent to do GBS on a few more samples from Howie's known pedigree file for robust comparison to IBD/IBS pedigree.
